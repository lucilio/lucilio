# Some about me: #

*Hacker* from São Paulo - SP, 47 years old, currently in love with Brasília - DF and interested on open technologies, knowledge transmission, environment, urbanism, civil rights, networking, politics, economy, music, good movies and in producing, writing, reviewing and editing good histories for interactive media. 

## Hack it ##

Everybody is a hacker -- or should be.

There is no existence for human being except the mediated by technologies. We are not doomed to play a consumer role on this mediation. We can create ourselves our technologies and improve that already existing ones.

If you think about computing technologies hacking seems to be something restricted to very few people around the world -- in comparsion to everybody else -- but when you think closes, food and faith are all technologies it's become clear that everybody is a kind of hacker in potential the same way my grandma uses needle and thread to hack her wardrobe.

I've been programing sites for the last ten years, mostly dealing with problems in WordPress based sites. WordPress powers a huge amount of websites -- specially considering those which are content managing platforms -- and sometimes looks like as I choose a specialized area of web developing when the specialized choose me instead :-).

I've coursed Data Processing at "Faculdade de Tecnologia de São Paulo" where learned that good development is agnostic, founded on good practices and adopting the best tools for each casa -- and that programming languages are "just tools". 

I believe in it and it's because I'm always looking to keep up to date with good practices -- and the tools required to each of them. I also coursed Journalism at "Faculdade Casper Libero" and it's probably the reason I work to content creators or managers most of time.
