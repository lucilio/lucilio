# Hacker? #

Call myself a hacker and I advocate everybody else is a hacker to -- or should be. Our existence in the world is inevitabli mediated by technology and except as a hacker we are dommed to act merely as conumer of that already existent tachnologies.

It's terrible, dont is? Well, It's also false. You may not consider yourself a hacker today only due to a lack of vision abou what a hacekr is. To make things clear, a example:

Dona Izaltina, my grandmother, born in 1925 is still today building things with wool and needles using two well known technologies: knit and crochet. Now, look at a minute: this is two important technologies of the clothing industry and I am merely a consumer of clothing technologies but my grandma, she is a clothing hacker. She can not only consume but create and modify not only products but the technologies itselfs.

I like to cook, I like to do myself repairs on my bike and I like to play guitar and I happen to like programing computers too -- and I choose to work with that last -- but I try to hack a few every technology I interact to, sometimes creating something new, sometimes teaching someone something old to me -- and see it become something new under other people's hands. To hack is to me the best way to exceed in things I love.
So, pleasure, my name is Lucilio Correia. I am a computer hacker :-)

I've been programing sites for the last ten years, mostly dealing with problems in WordPress based sites. WordPress powers a huge amount of websites -- specially considering those which are content managing platforms -- and sometimes looks like as I choose a specialized area of web developping when the specialized choose me instead :-).

I've coursed Data Processing at "Faculdade de Tecnologia de São Paulo" where learned that good development is agnostic, founded on good pratctices and adopting the best tools for each casa -- and that programming languages are "just tools". I believe that and still today I'm look to keep up to date with good practices -- and the tools required to each of them. I also coursed Journalism at "Faculdade Casper Libero" and it's probably the reason I work to content creators or managers most of time.
